3D Painting Software
ArmorPaint is a stand-alone software designed for physically-based texture painting. Drag & drop your 3D models and start painting. Receive instant visual feedback in the viewport as you paint.
Node Based
Work fast with the convenience of nodes. Paint with fully procedural materials. Build fill layers with material nodes. Use brush nodes to create patterns and procedural brushes.


GPU Accelerated
ArmorPaint is designed from scratch to run completely on the GPU. This results in a smooth 4K painting experience on a medium-power integrated hardware. Up to 16K texture painting is seamless using a high-end graphics card.
Ray Tracing
In development - ray-traced baking, painting effects and viewport rendering features running on Direct3D12 and Vulkan are in progress. ArmorPaint is powered by an in-house 3D rendering engine to achieve the best painting experience.


Live Link
In development - integrate ArmorPaint into existing 3D software using the live-link plugins. Unreal Engine and Unity plugin previews are now available for testing.
Baking
Bake texture maps for high-poly models instantly on your GPU. First ArmorPaintDXR builds featuring hardware accelerated ray-traced baking are now available for download.


Plugins
ArmorPaint bets heavily on extensibility. Enhance any part of the software through plugins with god-mode powers. Integrate new node systems or build custom material nodes.
